If there is no duplicate in the array, the mapping `f(index) = num` must be one to one, otherwise the mapping is many to one.

If we linked all the mappings up we can reduce this problem to cycle detection. In an array with duplicate numbers, there must be at least two `indexes` mapped to the same `num`, one of the `indexes` belongs to the cycle, the other belongs to the "straight line", thus the cycle entrance is the `num`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[0];
        do {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        } while (slow != fast);
        
        int ptr1 = slow;
        int ptr2 = nums[0];
        while (ptr1 != ptr2) {
            ptr1 = nums[ptr1];
            ptr2 = nums[ptr2];
        }
        return ptr1;
    }
}
```
